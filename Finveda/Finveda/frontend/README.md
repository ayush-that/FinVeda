# FinVeda - Predictive Analytics Tool for Investment Decisions

**FinVeda** is a Python-based predictive analytics tool designed to help users make better investment decisions by analyzing historical financial data and identifying trends. The tool leverages machine learning models to predict stock price movements, and provides insights on how different features impact investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw financial data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) on historical data.
- **Prediction**: Makes predictions on future stock prices based on trained models.
- **Visualization**: Plots the performance of models and their evaluation metrics.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates models using various metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes methods for feature extraction like logarithmic transformations, rolling averages, and percentage change.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost (optional)
- Flask (for deployment, if required)

To install the dependencies, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for training:

```bash
python backend/preprocess.py
```

This will load the raw data from `backend/data/raw_data.csv`, clean it, and output the processed data to `backend/data/processed_data.csv`.

### Train a Model

To train a predictive model, run the `model.py` script:

```bash
python backend/model.py
```

This script will:
- Load the preprocessed data.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest by default).
- Save the trained model as `backend/models/model.pkl`.

### Make Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data:

```bash
python backend/predict.py
```

This will load the trained model and predict stock prices for the data in `backend/data/test_data.csv`, outputting the results to `backend/data/predictions.csv`.

### Evaluation Metrics

The tool evaluates the model using various metrics. These include:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides the standard deviation of residuals, useful for assessing prediction accuracy.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

The evaluation results will be saved in the `logs/training.log` file.

### Visualization

Visualize feature importances and model performance:

```bash
python backend/visualize.py
```

This will generate plots and save them to the `plots/` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the model as an API, you can use the `Flask` app included in `backend/app.py`. This will expose a simple endpoint for making predictions.

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

You can send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with new data to get predictions.
